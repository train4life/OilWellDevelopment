# Project Title: Oil Well Location Selection for OilyGiant Mining Company

Overview:
Welcome to the Oil Well Location Selection project for OilyGiant Mining Company! In this GitHub repository, you'll find the code and resources to choose the best location for a new oil well. The project involves collecting oil well parameters, building a predictive model for reserve volume, and using the Bootstrapping technique to analyze potential profit and risks. The goal is to select the region that offers the highest profit margin for the new oil wells.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to build a predictive model to estimate the volume of reserves in potential oil wells and use the Bootstrapping technique to analyze potential profits and risks for selecting the best region.
